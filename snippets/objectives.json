You can also use `ticks` or `seconds` argument to use different units, but keep in mind that it's not very precise - it will complete roughly after the time ends. To control that precision you can specify an optional `interval:` argument, which specifies how many ticks should pass between checks. One second is 20 ticks. Less makes the objective more precise, at the expense of performance. The rest is just like in other objectives.\n\nDelay has two properties, `left` and `date`.

So if you type that, it will create a variable called `key`, which will resolve to `value` string. These are not global variables, you can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as `var` in your objectives.yml file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with `%objective.var.key%` - and in case of this example, it will resolve to `value`. The player can type something else, and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so my `key` variable will be different from your `key` variable, depending on what we were typing in chat. You can have as much variables here as you want. To remove this objective use `objective delete` event - there is no other way.\n\nYou can also use `variable` event to change variables stored in this objective.
