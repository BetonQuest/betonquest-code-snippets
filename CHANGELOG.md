# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):  
 1. **MAJOR** version will be incremented if the snippets are changed to match a new BetonQuest version  
 2. **MINOR** version will be incremented whenever the snippets themselves are changed  
 3. **PATCH** version will be incremented if only some snippets descriptions changed (as a result to updates to the BetonQuest wiki)
